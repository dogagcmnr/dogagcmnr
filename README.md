### Hi, I'm Doğa Göçmener.

I'm an International Trade and Logistics Specialist, currently studying my main subject Computer Science. I'm based in Katowice, Poland.

Since 2009, I'm developing and improving my life around programming with several languages. I've started my programming journey on Pascal big thanks to my mentor Mr.X. Most likelky beginning of a programming journey from that young age I don't see programming as a work. It's just pure fun for me to watch how things work as planned.

Mixing the years of experience in having fun of making programs work and having future insights on several topics like AI & ML & Cloud Computing and also IoT , I want to help the world to be a better place through my fingertips.

In the otherside I'm a **writer** so I write a lot about anything, *literally anything*. I'm planning to make a repository and share my writings also here in GitHub. By this statement I wanted to share my thoughts about writing, because most of young people waiting for an inspiration to get in to action. I'm here to let them know if you don't wait for an inspiration you'll have a lot of inspiration by the end of the day. I'm telling this as a person who challenged himself to fill 7 planners up as my sketchs and burn it down to sharpen my pencil to be a better writer.

### What I'm focusing on?

Currently improving my programming skills through Python, C++ and Java. However as I am to be a fullstack developer, I also doing React exercises to improve my frontend knowledge.
